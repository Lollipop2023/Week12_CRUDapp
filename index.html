<!--I really wanted to make a very simple little app for my elderly father to use. He has
to take his blood pressure and blood sugars multiple times a day, and about once a month he
takes these numbers to his doctors. Often he just puts them in a little notebook, but if he 
forgets it in another room or something he just jots it down and often forgets to transfer it.
The one thing he never leaves...his phone. So if they are recorded there, I think the doctors
would get a much more accurate idea of his day to day! So, I created a three input entry form
followed by a table to display those entries. HTML is my kinda language, simple and straight forward.-->
